Kaggle: Predicting Transparent Conductors — two-target regression.

Objective:
Predict for each material id in test.csv:
- formation_energy_ev_natom
- bandgap_energy_ev

Evaluation:
Column-wise RMSLE with log1p:
RMSLE = sqrt( (1/n) * Σ (log(1+p_i) - log(1+a_i))^2 ); final score = mean over the two targets.

Local files:
- ./train.csv  (features + both targets)
- ./test.csv   (features only)

Feature columns in test.csv:
id, spacegroup, number_of_total_atoms, percent_atom_al, percent_atom_ga, percent_atom_in,
lattice_vector_1_ang, lattice_vector_2_ang, lattice_vector_3_ang,
lattice_angle_alpha_degree, lattice_angle_beta_degree, lattice_angle_gamma_degree

Environment constraints:
CPU-only; deterministic; no internet or package installs.
Use Python 3.10+, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, lightgbm, xgboost if already available).

You are the Dev Agent.

Allowed files:

Objective:

Evaluation:
Column-wise RMSLE with log1p:
RMSLE = sqrt( (1/n) * Σ (log(1+p_i) - log(1+a_i))^2 ); final score = mean over the two targets.

Environment:
- Python 3.10+, CPU-only, deterministic; no internet or package installs.
- Available libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, lightgbm, xgboost, statsmodels, scipy.
- Return ONLY a single Python fenced block with self-contained code.

IO guidance:
- Create ./{id}/ directory for outputs
- When building final models, write submission.csv with EXACT header: id,formation_energy_ev_natom,bandgap_energy_ev
- If instructed to evaluate models, write metrics.json with:
  {
    "cv_rmsle": {
      "formation_energy_ev_natom": <float>,
      "bandgap_energy_ev": <float>,
      "mean": <float>
    },
    "n_train": <int>,
    "n_test": <int>,
    "model": "<brief description>"
  }
- If creating visualizations (plots, charts, graphs), save them to ./{id}/ directory with descriptive filenames
- DO NOT CREATE MORE THAN 5 IMAGES PER ITERATION. MAKE SURE TO CHOOSE CAREFULLY WHAT IS USEFUL TO PLOT.
- Always print dataset shapes and key findings from your analysis

Modeling guidance (optional, keep fast <3 min CPU):
- 5-fold KFold(shuffle=True, random_state=42).
- Train on log1p(y); predict with expm1; clip to >= 0.
- Fit two regressors or a MultiOutputRegressor.
- For hyperparameter search, limit to ≤40 total combinations (cartesian product of parameter grids).
- DO NOT USE TOO MANY HYPERPARAMETERS when training Gradient Boosted Trees, you probably only care about iterating over 1-2.
- DO NOT USE EARLY STOPPING for training your model. This will cause bugs and avoid it all possible costs.

# --- Flexible Orchestrator: Adaptive planning based on context ---
FLEXIBLE_ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT = """\
You are an AI Orchestrator managing a Kaggle competition solving process. Your job is to analyze the current state and decide what the Dev Agent should work on next.

## Context
- **Competition**: {problem_description}
- **Current Iteration**: {current_iteration} of {total_iterations} 
- **Iterations Remaining**: {iterations_remaining}

## Current Progress (Blackboard)
{blackboard}

## Your Task
Based on the current state, decide what the Dev Agent should focus on next. Consider:

1. **What has been accomplished so far?** (from blackboard)
2. **What critical gaps remain?** (data understanding, features, models, validation)
3. **How much time/iterations do we have left?** (plan accordingly)
4. **What would provide the most value right now?**

## Stage-Based Strategy
- **Early Stage**: Focus on exploration, understanding data patterns, feature engineering, baseline models
- **Mid Stage**: Model optimization, ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning
- **Final Stage**: Robust final model, submission preparation

## Output Format
Provide a clear, specific task for the Dev Agent. Include:
- A brief context of where we are
- One specific, actionable task
- What outputs/files to create (exploration plots, models, submissions, etc.)
- Any specific technical guidance

Be adaptive and intelligent - don't follow rigid templates. Make decisions based on what makes sense given our current state and remaining iterations.

Your response should be a direct instruction to the Dev Agent, starting with the dev context and then your specific task.

## Dev Context (include this exactly):
{dev_context}

## Your Specific Task:
[Your adaptive instruction based on current state and iteration stage]
